                    their religious convictions, objected to providing coverage for
                    them. The main claim made by Hobby Lobby was that the ACA's mandate
                    for contraceptive coverage infringed on their right to religious
                    freedom under the RFRA. The business argued that certain forms of
                    contraception shouldn't be covered by insurance (plaintiff

                    claimed that the requirements for contraceptive coverage were
                    necessary to guarantee women's access to crucial medical services.
                    The contraceptive mandate was cited as the main justification for
                    the US government's position that women needed to have access to

                    Since the lower courts reached conflicting conclusions regarding whether for-profit businesses,
                    particularly closely held ones, could claim a religious exemption from the Affordable Care Act's
                    requirement that they cover contraception, the case was appealed to the Supreme Court.

                    The court ruled in Hobby Lobby's favor. claiming that the right to religious freedom enjoyed by
                    for-profit corporations was hampered by the contraceptive mandate supported by Patient Protection
                    and Affordable. They used this method of decoding because the owners of Hobby
                    Lobby claimed that requiring their staff to use birth control went against their religious
                    principles.
                    It was a 5 to 4 vote.

                    Justice Antony Kennedy argued in the concurring opinion that the government could have
                    found a less onerous way to grant women access to contraception without interfering with
                    corporate religious freedoms. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, on the other
                    hand, dissented from both the conclusions and the logic of the majority opinion in their
                    dissenting opinions. The majority decision, they claimed, had expanded corporate rights in an
                    unheard-of way.

                    Since the case's resolution increased religious freedom at the expense of women's
                    reproductive rights, many people think that the case was unfairly resolved. Additionally, it
                    created a risky precedent for businesses looking to get around other federal laws. It raised the
                    issue of whether these corporations qualified for protections for religious freedom under the
                    RFRA and the First Amendment. Legal experts contend that this RFRA interpretation was too
                    broad and at odds with the law's original goals.

                The case was significant because it reduced the ACA's mandate that all employers cover
                contraceptives and broadened the scope of corporate rights to exercise their religion. It had
                implications for how much contraceptive coverage was required by the ACA, the rights of
                corporations to practice their religion, and ongoing discussions about the place of corporations
